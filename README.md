# odin-project-recipes

A recipe site with a few links to simple recipes on the homepage.

Once completed, I will have demonstrated a basic understanding of HTML
and the fundamental tags that make up the language.

Now that I have completed this small project, I learnt a bit more about
git and how nesting of lists should be done (nest ol/ul's inside of li, not inside of other ol/ul's)
